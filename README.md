# GDRecruit
GDRecruit is a tool by myself (The Ice States) to facilitate recruitment in [Greater Dienstad](https://www.nationstates.net/region=greater_dienstad). I encourage you to join or visit Greater Dienstad, which is the main beneficiary of this tool.

# CTE Timer
Please go [here](https://canineanimal.github.io/GDRecruit/pages/timer.html) for this resource, to detect how many nations will cease to exist in Greater Dienstad by the next update. 

# Setting up
You must receive permission from myself or [The Macabees](https://www.nationstates.net/page=region_control/region=greater_dienstad) to be able to recruit -- otherwise, neither NationStates nor GDRecruit will allow you to send recruitment telegrams. Once you have received such permission, you should create a recruitment template. To this, from your nation in Greater Dienstad, send a telegram addressed to "tag:template", containing the text of your recruitment telegram. You are strongly encouraged to use the existing template [here](https://github.com/CanineAnimal/GDRecruit/raw/main/template.txt); simply copy and paste it into the telegram content box; however, you can use your own if you want.

Once you do this, your telegram page should show you a telegram template code, which looks something like %TEMPLATE-29210386%. Record this in a place that you can access it -- it need not be secret, and if you forget you can find it in your sent telegram folder.

# Recruiting
To recruit, first visit [this page](https://canineanimal.github.io/GDRecruit/pages/rec.html). There, enter your GD nation, the telegram template code, and a verification code (which you can generate by pressing the link in the login page while logged into your GD nation in NationStates), and click the "Log in" button.

Assuming you have set up correctly and received permission to recruit, this will change to a white screen with a button saying "Recruit". Click this while logged into your GD nation -- it will send you to your telegram page in a new tab, with both the recipients and telegram message filled in. Then press "Send" on the telegram page, and press the "Acknowledge" button in the GDRecruit page.

Each few minutes or so, the loading text will change to the "Recruit" button, which you use as directed above. A short ringtone will also be played when it is ready -- you can turn this off by unchecking the "Notify" checkbox in the GDRecruit page.

To finish recruiting, simply close your GDRecruit tab.

# Blacklisting strings
To help avoid targeting obvious puppets for recruitment (thereby reducing wait between the sending of recruitment telegrams), you can blacklist strings, such that nations whose names include these strings will not be targeted for recruitment. For example, if a ton of nations named "Icestates-001", "Icestates-002" etc are being included in recruitment telegrams, blacklisting "Icestates-" will filter out these nations. It is recommended to avoid blacklisting excessively short strings, to avoid the Scunthorpe problem where unrelated nations will be filtered out due to having the string; it is preferible to have more nations receive the recruitment telegram in exchange for waiting slightly longer between recruitment telegrams, than to have potential recruits excluded.
