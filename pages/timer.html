		<H1>CTE Timer</H1>
		<BR/>
		This resource exists to time how many nations will cease to exist in Greater Dienstad by the next update. Updates occur twice daily in the NationStates game, at 9 PM and 9 AM PST.
		<BR/>
		<BR/>
		Please note that nations which have not been logged into in 28 days will be counted as to CTE, regardless of whether they are on vacation mode, as this is impossible to accurately detect. CTE numbers may therefore be slightly overestimated.
		<BR/>
		<BR/>
		Please enter your nation name: <INPUT ID="NATION"/>
