Greetings, %NATION%!

Your telegram inbox likely has been -- or is about to -- be filled with a number of telegrams inviting you to other regions. While this may be off-putting, the region you first choose to join is still a very important choice, and will likely significantly affect what you end up doing in NationStates down the line.

[b]I would like to warmly invite you to join [region]Greater Dienstad[/region], which is one of the friendliest and most welcoming communities I have met on NationStates.[/b] We are also one of the oldest regions here, with our community being originally established way back in 2004.

In that time, [b]we have become one of the largest and most influential roleplay regions on the site.[/b] You can build collaboratively written storylines involving our nations, and also engage in building detailed backstory and lore surrounding your nation. Further, the region has a set of experienced mentors who can show you the ropes and help you on your journey in Greater Diesntad.

Our prowess in roleplaying has given the region a [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=WA_past_resolution/id=260/council=2]World Assembly commendation[/url], an honour granted to very few regions. Join Greater Dienstad to become a part of one of the oldest and greatest regions on the site.

PS. I am a real person, so don't hesitate to reply if you have any questions :)
